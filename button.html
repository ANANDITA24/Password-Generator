    <p>PASSWORD GENERATOR
    <br><br> Password Generator software offers a good 
    display of all your credentials. As such, it saves
     you from memorizing hundreds of passwords except 
     the generator's login details. The primary objective of
      using a generator is creation of strong and unpredictable
       passwords for all of your accounts.</P>

       <p1>PASSWORD STRENGTH
        <br><br> Password strength is a measure of the 
        effectiveness of a password against guessing or 
        brute-force attacks. In its usual form, it estimates
         how many trials an attacker who does not have direct
         access to the password would need, on average, to guess it correctly.</P1>
